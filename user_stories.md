```
Background:
* This story should use the Oxford Dictionaries API https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/documentation
* Use endpoint “GET /inflections/{source_lang}/{word_id}” under the “Lemmatron” heading

Feature:
As a guest user (no sign in necessary)
When I visit “/”
And I fill in a text box with “foxes”
And I click “Validate Word”
Then I should see a message that says “‘foxes’ is a valid word and its root form is ‘fox’.”

As a guest user
When I visit “/”
And I fill in a text box with “foxez”
And I click “Validate Word”
Then I should see a message that says “‘foxez’ is not a valid word.”
```

*Feature 2: API - Viewing Game Score*

```
Background: This story assumes the base data from running `rake db:seed`

When I send a GET request to “/api/v1/games/1” I receive a JSON response as follows:

```{
  "game_id":1,
  "scores": [
    {
      "user_id":1,
      "score":15
    },
    {
      "user_id":2,
      "score":16
    }
  ]
}
```

*Feature 3: API - Posting a Play*

```
Background: This story assumes the base data from running `rake db:seed`

You can choose to send the user_id and word specified below however you’d like or are comfortable.

When I send a POST request to “/api/v1/games/1/plays” with a user_id=1 and word=at
Then I should receive a 201 Created Response

When I send a GET request to “/api/v1/games/1" I receive a JSON response as follows:

```{
  "game_id":1,
  "scores": [
    {
      "user_id":1,
      "score":17
    },
    {
      "user_id":2,
      "score":16
    }
  ]
}```
